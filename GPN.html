                        <p>
                            Game 1.	City Taxi Simulator 3d
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fairly good graphics, and good choice of audio for background music. Appropriate colour scheme and fonts were used. The interface is simple and very easy to understand. However, the taxi’s engine does not sound very realistic, and the handling on the car is terrible. Objective location is not mapped out and no route is clearly shown, only a general direction of where the objective is. The levels are not well-timed as the time to complete is too short to make a possible run, with the added refuel and off road slowing the car down. There were many bugs too, such as the car going under the map when it went under the bridge, and the car being stuck in dithes for a long time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game would be better if the physics of the car was fixed, such as the friction, and the handling be improved for smoother driving. A map should also be added with a highlighted route showing where to go, so players would not be lost. The time limit should be removed, and instead award points based on how much time they take, allowing users to finish the game at their own pace.

                            Game 2.	Dreamside Maroon
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fantastic graphics, with good world generation and good attention to details such as shadows and lighting. Good font choices and good audio used, appropriate for an adventure game. Game was overall simple and easy to understand. However, controls were hard to learn as it is different from regular movement controls. The camera angles is most times bad, even when I use the reset camera angle function, it makes it hard to see my player and whee exactly am I heading to. Overall, the controls were not a huge deal breaker, but the camera angle makes it hard to play the game and I would improve on that as it is the biggest setback.

                        <p>
                            We decided to go for a school-based music game, as it brings a unique idea from concepts that are familiar to the gaming world. This icnludes the rhythm game part, which is familiar to most gamers with titles
                            such as Osu! and Cytus. Xuan Wei came up with an idea to incorperate mechanics of different popular rhythm games, so as to create a fusion of ideas that create a more challenging game to play, from games like Osu! and Dance of Fire and Ice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Xuan Wei came up with the majority of the game mechanics. He came up with the idea that the default controls are in the home row of the keyboard, this is to allow new players to have the most comfortable controls. 
                            Xuan Wei also came up with the idea of non-regenerative health points during each track, with modifications to increase the difficulties, an interesting twist to the health system in Osu!.
                            He also came up with multiplayer, a way for users to create tracks fronm their favourite songs and release them for others to play.
                            I camee up with a system of ranking against Non-Player Characters(NPCs), to add milestone that give a sense of achievement, and a level system split by genre and instrument, to add a new depth of difficulty
                            and for users to experience different genres of music.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I came up with the main storyline of the game. I had a story of a person who was looked down upon, but rose to the top, as a way to not only make users feel proud for being top and beating the game, but also motivate them 
                            to face obstacles and negative opinions, to push through to pursue their goals. The story went through a few revisions but the beginning was set in a few days. During a session with the teacher, I understood a flaw in the story.
                            The flaw that being rank 1 is just a position, that there was not really a benefit from being rank 1. That's when I decided to add in a final boss. As do most bosses, this level had to be extremely difficult, but still doable for most players.
                            This not only gives a sinister twist to the story, and give players a challenge that makes them feel proud when they finish it.
