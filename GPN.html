                        <p>
                            Game 1.	City Taxi Simulator 3d
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fairly good graphics, and good choice of audio for background music. Appropriate colour scheme and fonts were used. The interface is simple and very easy to understand. However, the taxi’s engine does not sound very realistic, and the handling on the car is terrible. Objective location is not mapped out and no route is clearly shown, only a general direction of where the objective is. The levels are not well-timed as the time to complete is too short to make a possible run, with the added refuel and off road slowing the car down. There were many bugs too, such as the car going under the map when it went under the bridge, and the car being stuck in dithes for a long time.
                        </p>

                            The game would be better if the physics of the car was fixed, such as the friction, and the handling be improved for smoother driving. A map should also be added with a highlighted route showing where to go, so players would not be lost. The time limit should be removed, and instead award points based on how much time they take, allowing users to finish the game at their own pace.

                            Game 2.	Dreamside Maroon
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fantastic graphics, with good world generation and good attention to details such as shadows and lighting. Good font choices and good audio used, appropriate for an adventure game. Game was overall simple and easy to understand. However, controls were hard to learn as it is different from regular movement controls. The camera angles is most times bad, even when I use the reset camera angle function, it makes it hard to see my player and whee exactly am I heading to. Overall, the controls were not a huge deal breaker, but the camera angle makes it hard to play the game and I would improve on that as it is the biggest setback.
