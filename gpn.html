                        <p>
                            Game 1.	City Taxi Simulator 3d
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fairly good graphics, and good choice of audio for background music. Appropriate colour scheme and fonts were used. The interface is simple and very easy to understand. However, the taxi’s engine does not sound very realistic, and the handling on the car is terrible. Objective location is not mapped out and no route is clearly shown, only a general direction of where the objective is. The levels are not well-timed as the time to complete is too short to make a possible run, with the added refuel and off road slowing the car down. There were many bugs too, such as the car going under the map when it went under the bridge, and the car being stuck in dithes for a long time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game would be better if the physics of the car was fixed, such as the friction, and the handling be improved for smoother driving. A map should also be added with a highlighted route showing where to go, so players would not be lost. The time limit should be removed, and instead award points based on how much time they take, allowing users to finish the game at their own pace.
                        </p>

                            Game 2.	Dreamside Maroon
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fantastic graphics, with good world generation and good attention to details such as shadows and lighting. Good font choices and good audio used, appropriate for an adventure game. Game was overall simple and easy to understand. However, controls were hard to learn as it is different from regular movement controls. The camera angles is most times bad, even when I use the reset camera angle function, it makes it hard to see my player and whee exactly am I heading to. Overall, the controls were not a huge deal breaker, but the camera angle makes it hard to play the game and I would improve on that as it is the biggest setback.

                        <p>
                            The profile matches why I enjoy the games that I do. As the profile states, I like games with both high skill levels and social aspects to them. The only game I would not consider part of this that I enjoy would be games like 
                            Don't Starve Together and Minecraft. These games, in my opinion are more casual games I play with friends than something I would tryhard on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Out of the 10 games, I have only played Battlefield, more specifically Battlefield 4. I enjoy Battlefield as it has really good graphics and sounds, with challenging gameplay and unique movement mechanics that other First-Person Shooters(FPSs)
                            don't have. Most of the games listed, I am not very interested in them. Call of Duty was mentioned several times but I do not like it as it is expensive and does not have a large player base. Some of the other games like Black Desert Online 
                            sound interesting and I may try them when I have free time.

                        <p>
                            I really enjoy the Squad and Undirected Exploration mechanics. Squad allows me to use different characters to think and develop strategies for defeating different enemies. It also allows me to customise and use different abilities, allowing for a more diverse ga,eplay.
                            I like undirected exploration as it gives me the liberty to freely roam the game world. I personally enjoy the feeling of moving anywhere I want, and exploring new worlds or areas that I have not been to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I personally do not enjoy the Cut Off One Head, Two Grow Back and Information Overload mechanics. The Cut Off One Head, Two Grow Back mechanics seems really annoying and makes the game exponentially harder, to the point where you remove the fun aspect of it.
                            Information Overload, to me, is also a bad thing. I would rather be eased into the story and understand the circumstances at a steady pace, than for a lot of information being thrown my way for me to decypher.
                        </p>
                        <p>Game Idea based on these random mechanics: Jumping, Avoid Unkillable Objects, Game Keeps Gets Harder Until You Die</p>
                        <p>
                            I would design a Geometry Dash style game, where players control a cube that jumps across Lava and other obstacles. The game would have multiiple levels but no save, with each level become more and more challenging. 
                            If the player fails the level and dies, he would have to restart the levels again.

                        <p>
                            Character Design: Tall boy, about 185cm, and looks about 17. He has Brown hair with orange eyes. He would be wearing a typical Japanese High School Uniform, and is wearing a silver watch and a pair of black glasses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The story starts when Amos, a world famous doctor, who died in from old age complications. He was then transported to another world, where he reborn into an ordinary home, in a world that seemed backward compared to waht he knew. However, he had memories of his old life. As such, when he was 10,
                            out of fear of losing the medicine he knew, he jotted down everything on a notebook and kept it in his room, so nobody knew about his secret knowledge. However, during his last year in High School, the country was hit by a virus that no one had known.
                            Using his knowledge, he realised it drew resemblence to the Black Plague, and had its cure written on the notebook. Help Amos to explore this new world and find the right materials to build machinery and develop the cure for this disease, before it wipes out the wole nation.

                        <p>
                            I really enjoy First Person-Shooters(FPSs) and I enjoy Open World Games. FPSs are unique in that players player from the character's view instead of a spectator's view. I like how most FPSs are quick paced
                            and require a bunch of skills like counter-strafing, aim and recoil control, and I like the fact that I can play with all my friends as they too play FPSs. I like open world games as they give me a lot of freedom to explore the game,
                            instead of following a set of rules and controls like most games. Open World games also are usually more casual compared to FPSs and it helps me to relax when I am playing open world games with my friends.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, I tend not to enjoy tower defence. I feel like the gameplay gets stale once you reach the end. There is also no room for unique gameplay as compared to open world games. Most tower defence games also 
                            require a lot of time to grind for materials, which gets really repitive and unenjoyable.

                        <p>
                            We decided to go for a school-based music game, as it brings a unique idea from concepts that are familiar to the gaming world. This icnludes the rhythm game part, which is familiar to most gamers with titles
                            such as Osu! and Cytus. Xuan Wei came up with an idea to incorperate mechanics of different popular rhythm games, so as to create a fusion of ideas that create a more challenging game to play, from games like Osu! and Dance of Fire and Ice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Xuan Wei came up with the majority of the game mechanics. He came up with the idea that the default controls are in the home row of the keyboard, this is to allow new players to have the most comfortable controls. 
                            Xuan Wei also came up with the idea of non-regenerative health points during each track, with modifications to increase the difficulties, an interesting twist to the health system in Osu!.
                            He also came up with multiplayer, a way for users to create tracks fronm their favourite songs and release them for others to play.
                            I camee up with a system of ranking against Non-Player Characters(NPCs), to add milestone that give a sense of achievement, and a level system split by genre and instrument, to add a new depth of difficulty
                            and for users to experience different genres of music.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I came up with the main storyline of the game. I had a story of a person who was looked down upon, but rose to the top, as a way to not only make users feel proud for being top and beating the game, but also motivate them 
                            to face obstacles and negative opinions, to push through to pursue their goals. The story went through a few revisions but the beginning was set in a few days. During a session with the teacher, I understood a flaw in the story.
                            The flaw that being rank 1 is just a position, that there was not really a benefit from being rank 1. That's when I decided to add in a final boss. As do most bosses, this level had to be extremely difficult, but still doable for most players.
                            This not only gives a sinister twist to the story, and give players a challenge that makes them feel proud when they finish it.

                        <p>
                            We have not figured out what engine or what storyline the game should be. But I suggested either a bullet hell type game or a Tower Defence Game. This is because they are 2d games that seem possible to program within a few weeks to make and fun to play.
                        </p>
                        <h3 style="margin: 0; padding-top: 5%; padding-bottom: 2%;">Week 2-3</h3>
                        <p>
                            After much consideration, we decided to use godot. Not only was it free to use,  
                            but it also allows for collaborative work, unlike GameMaker Studio 1.4, and also 
                            is not as complex as Unity. However, we decided to change to a puzzle game, as we wanted a more complete game 
                            and tower defence or bullet hell will not be finished if a good story is added. However, we are still 
                            considering the kinds of puzzle and game concept.
                        </p>
                        <h3 style="margin: 0; padding-top: 5%; padding-bottom: 2%;">Week 4</h3>
                        <p>
                            We decided to make our game out of GameMaker Studio as we had a lot of issues figuring out Godot, and github seemed to not be
                            working well with Godot. Xuan Wei suggested an idea of an escape room type of game, and I built on that as it 
                            reminded me of an ancient Greek story, Daedalus's Labyrinth. This gave us an idea of a game set in a labyrinth, where
                            players had to navigate through mazes and solve puzzles to escape. I suggested the name "No Way Out" as the game seemed 
                            like an endless puzzle that does not have a way out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also started to develop the game prototype on GameMaker Studio. With the help of several youtube videos, I was able to make the 
                            main menu, credits page and rough version of the dialogue page.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Much progress has been made, Xuan Wei added the dialogue for the introduction to the game, with a typewriter sound effect. I also added 
                            echoed footsteps for additional realism and started on the first puzzle room of the game.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finished designing the mazes, and Xuan Wei made the player with collision detection. We made the user input objects, with validation for the correct
                            answer. I also made a list of puzzle ideas with the correct answers to keep track of the puzzle we are making.
                        </p>
                        <h3 style="margin: 0; padding-top: 5%; padding-bottom: 2%;">Week 7</h3>
                        <p>
                            Finished the game prototype. We made 3 puzzles, and changed the second puzzle conecpt as ur seemed too simple. Also added the final dialogue section
                            and added the to be continued page that leads to the main page. This is so even though the gamne story is not concluded, there is a transition to the main page.
                            Added the death scene that also leads to the main screen, we did not add save points as the game is too short for a save points as there are only three puzzles for now.
                            Instead, we have a plan to have floors with the puzzles, so that svae points would only save at the start of each floor, as the game progresses with more floors.
