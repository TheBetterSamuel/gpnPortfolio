                        <p>
                            Game 1.	City Taxi Simulator 3d
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fairly good graphics, and good choice of audio for background music. Appropriate colour scheme and fonts were used. The interface is simple and very easy to understand. However, the taxi’s engine does not sound very realistic, and the handling on the car is terrible. Objective location is not mapped out and no route is clearly shown, only a general direction of where the objective is. The levels are not well-timed as the time to complete is too short to make a possible run, with the added refuel and off road slowing the car down. There were many bugs too, such as the car going under the map when it went under the bridge, and the car being stuck in dithes for a long time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game would be better if the physics of the car was fixed, such as the friction, and the handling be improved for smoother driving. A map should also be added with a highlighted route showing where to go, so players would not be lost. The time limit should be removed, and instead award points based on how much time they take, allowing users to finish the game at their own pace.
                        </p>

                            Game 2.	Dreamside Maroon
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fantastic graphics, with good world generation and good attention to details such as shadows and lighting. Good font choices and good audio used, appropriate for an adventure game. Game was overall simple and easy to understand. However, controls were hard to learn as it is different from regular movement controls. The camera angles is most times bad, even when I use the reset camera angle function, it makes it hard to see my player and whee exactly am I heading to. Overall, the controls were not a huge deal breaker, but the camera angle makes it hard to play the game and I would improve on that as it is the biggest setback.

                        <p>
                            We decided to go for a school-based music game, as it brings a unique idea from concepts that are familiar to the gaming world. This icnludes the rhythm game part, which is familiar to most gamers with titles
                            such as Osu! and Cytus. Xuan Wei came up with an idea to incorperate mechanics of different popular rhythm games, so as to create a fusion of ideas that create a more challenging game to play, from games like Osu! and Dance of Fire and Ice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Xuan Wei came up with the majority of the game mechanics. He came up with the idea that the default controls are in the home row of the keyboard, this is to allow new players to have the most comfortable controls. 
                            Xuan Wei also came up with the idea of non-regenerative health points during each track, with modifications to increase the difficulties, an interesting twist to the health system in Osu!.
                            He also came up with multiplayer, a way for users to create tracks fronm their favourite songs and release them for others to play.
                            I camee up with a system of ranking against Non-Player Characters(NPCs), to add milestone that give a sense of achievement, and a level system split by genre and instrument, to add a new depth of difficulty
                            and for users to experience different genres of music.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I came up with the main storyline of the game. I had a story of a person who was looked down upon, but rose to the top, as a way to not only make users feel proud for being top and beating the game, but also motivate them 
                            to face obstacles and negative opinions, to push through to pursue their goals. The story went through a few revisions but the beginning was set in a few days. During a session with the teacher, I understood a flaw in the story.
                            The flaw that being rank 1 is just a position, that there was not really a benefit from being rank 1. That's when I decided to add in a final boss. As do most bosses, this level had to be extremely difficult, but still doable for most players.
                            This not only gives a sinister twist to the story, and give players a challenge that makes them feel proud when they finish it.

                        <p>
                            We have not figured out what engine or what storyline the game should be. But I suggested either a bullet hell type game or a Tower Defence Game. This is because they are 2d games that seem possible to program within a few weeks to make and fun to play.
                        </p>
                        <h3 style="margin: 0; padding-top: 5%; padding-bottom: 2%;">Week 2-3</h3>
                        <p>
                            After much consideration, we decided to use godot. Not only was it free to use,  
                            but it also allows for collaborative work, unlike GameMaker Studio 1.4, and also 
                            is not as complex as Unity. However, we decided to change to a puzzle game, as we wanted a more complete game 
                            and tower defence or bullet hell will not be finished if a good story is added. However, we are still 
                            considering the kinds of puzzle and game concept.
                        </p>
                        <h3 style="margin: 0; padding-top: 5%; padding-bottom: 2%;">Week 4</h3>
                        <p>
                            We decided to make our game out of GameMaker Studio as we had a lot of issues figuring out Godot, and github seemed to not be
                            working well with Godot. Xuan Wei suggested an idea of an escape room type of game, and I built on that as it 
                            reminded me of an ancient Greek story, Daedalus's Labyrinth. This gave us an idea of a game set in a labyrinth, where
                            players had to navigate through mazes and solve puzzles to escape. I suggested the name "No Way Out" as the game seemed 
                            like an endless puzzle that does not have a way out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also started to develop the game prototype on GameMaker Studio. With the help of several youtube videos, I was able to make the 
                            main menu, credits page and rough version of the dialogue page.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Much progress has been made, Xuan Wei added the dialogue for the introduction to the game, with a typewriter sound effect. I also added 
                            echoed footsteps for additional realism and started on the first puzzle room of the game.
                        </p>
                        <h3 style="margin: 0; padding-top: 5%; padding-bottom: 2%;">Week 6</h3>
                        <p>
                            Finished designing the mazes, and Xuan Wei made the player with collision detection. We made the user input objects, with validation for the correct
                            answer. I also made a list of puzzle ideas with the correct answers to keep track of the puzzle we are making.
                        </p>
                        <h3 style="margin: 0; padding-top: 5%; padding-bottom: 2%;">Week 7</h3>
                        <p>
                            Finished the game prototype. We made 3 puzzles, and changed the second puzzle conecpt as ur seemed too simple. Also added the final dialogue section
                            and added the to be continued page that leads to the main page. This is so even though the gamne story is not concluded, there is a transition to the main page.
                            Added the death scene that also leads to the main screen, we did not add save points as the game is too short for a save points as there are only three puzzles for now.
                            Instead, we have a plan to have floors with the puzzles, so that svae points would only save at the start of each floor, as the game progresses with more floors.
