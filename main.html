                 <p>
                     I am Samuel, a second-year student in Nee Ann Polytechnic's School of ICT.
                     I am currently pursuing a diploma in Information Technology.
                     I hope to have a career as a game programmer so this portfolio will showcase
                     my work, both school and personal projects.

                <p style="width: 75vw">
                    I grew up with games, from the Wii Sports console to the newest installment in Civilisation.
                    I grew uup playing Wii Sports with my siblings, and playing Mario Kart and Mario Party
                    wiith my cousins on the Nintendo DS. Soon, I moved to mobile games, playing minecraft and
                    Plants vs Zombies on a small iPhone screen. Right before secondary school, I discovered a 
                    first-person shooter(FPS) called Team Fortress 2, and I have been gaming on my computer
                    ever since. I have played close to 40 games since I started. Music games like Osu! and
                    Muse Dash, Adventure Games like Trove and Genshin Impact, Sandbox games like ARK Survival and 
                    Grand Theft Auto V, FPSs like Valorant and Counter-Strike Global Offensive. The list keeps going
                    on and on, and I hope to try out any new games and explore the many genres and themes games have to offer.

                <p style="width: 75vw; padding-bottom: 10vh">
                    Ever since I finished O levels, I always wanted to make games. I wanted to make games for peopple to
                    enjoy after a long day of work, or to have fun with their family and friends. After I made my first simple game,
                    it spurred me to learn more as I now understood the creative process that goes behind programming games.
                    Joining this elective was a way for me to understand the industry better as well, as I did not understand 
                    how a team of game developers could function together, or how business was done behind the scenes. All in all,
                    I joined GPN to better understand game development and prepare myself for the gaming industry.
